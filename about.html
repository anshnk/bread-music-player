    <br>
    <center><p style="max-width:50%">Bread Music Player is a tiny web music player where you can import songs, create playlists, and more. This was made because I wanted a spotify-like program where I could listen to my mp3 files, but with as much customization in the app as I wanted. This project was also my first use of flexboxes in CSS and taught me a lot.</p></center>
